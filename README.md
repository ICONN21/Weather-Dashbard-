This challenge provided some great opportunities to practice the material we had covered in class.

I enjoy using API tools to fetch information, as I see them as a very powerful tool that can accomplish many objectives. Although it can be a bit frustrating trying to narrow down and get the correct API link, once that is handled, the developer has a lot of creative freedom with the information fetched.

For me, the biggest hurdle I encountered was making sure all of my functions were able to access the data received. Once I had the data in the correct scope, it just became a matter of making sure I looped through the data properly to access the information needed.
